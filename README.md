### Plebnet Playground Docker Dependencies
---
This container includes all the files needed to create base docker images used in the Plebnet Playground Project.
Images will built with workflow and published to https://github.com/orgs/PLEBNET-PLAYGROUND/packages

## Notes
- This is not live yet, and should not be relied upon as a source of truth as to how docker containers for Playground are constructed yet. Current implementations of plebnet-playground-docker and plebnet-playground-clustser are completely self contained with docker image build source.
